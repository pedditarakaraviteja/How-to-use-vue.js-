#How to use Vue.js

There are different ways to include Vue.js in your web project:
Use CDN by including <script> tag in HTML file
Install using Node Package Manager (NPM)
Install using Bower
Use Vue-cli to setup your project.

#Using Vue-cli

First, we need to install Vue-cli. 
The commend line interface is available as an NPM package. 
Make sure that Node.js and the npm command is available on your system and use the following command to install the Vue CLI globally on your local system:

CMD:
 $ npm install -g vue-cli.

Having installed the client successfully the vue command becomes available.
Now we're able to initiate a project by using this command in the following way:

CMD:
$ vue init webpack vueapp01

The project is created in the folder vueapp01. Change into that directory with the following command:

 CMD:
$ cd vueapp01

 Start installing the dependencies by using npm again:

CMD:
 $ npm install

After having completed the installation of packages you can start the web server in development mode by using npm in the following way:

CMD:
$ npm run dev
